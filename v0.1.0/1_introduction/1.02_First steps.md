## First steps
---

### Creating an User Account
After checking if the package is installed you need to create an user account

```command
$ tp register
```

A signup form will appear:

```
Username: pultz-lucas
Email: templo@email.com
Password: *****
Confirm your password: *****
```

### Creating Repository
After creating an user account you need to create a repository that will be used to store templates.

```command
$ tp init
``` 

This command will create the template repository.

### Saving templates to the repository
In the beginning there will be no template saved in the repository, so let's see now how to save a template.

First I need a real project to use as a reference.

Below is my example project:

```
ProjectWeb
   L src
      L style.css
      L script.js 
   L index.html
```

My example project is simple but larger projects can be saved in the repository.

To save we will use the save command:

```command
$ tp save ProjectWeb project-web
```

if you look into your local repository the "project-web" will be there.

```command
$ tp repo
```

output:

```
>> Local Templates
   | project-web

>> Remote Templates
```

### Creating a project from template
Creating a project from template is very simple.

Having the root folder where will be created the project, which in my case will be **Website**, use the command **create** to instantiate the template:

```command
$ tp create project-web Website
```

If created successfully, a success message will appear and you will have a project identical to the other.

Ready! You can now save templates and create projects with Templo.
