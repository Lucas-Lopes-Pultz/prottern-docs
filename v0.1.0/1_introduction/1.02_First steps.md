### Saving templates in repository
In the beginning there will be no template saved in the repository, so let's see now how to save a template.

First you need to have real files and folders structured to use it as reference.

Below is my example structure:

```
ProjectWeb
   L src
      L style.css
      L script.js 
   L index.html
```

My example is simple but larger structures of files and folders can be used as reference.

To save we will use the **save** command:

```command
$ tp save ProjectWeb project-web
```

if you look into your local repository the "project-web" will be there.

```command
$ tp repo
```

output:

```
+-------------+----------+---------------+---------------------+
│    name     │  owner   │ template_type │     created_at      │
+-------------+----------+---------------+---------------------+
│ project-web │   user   │     Local     │ 2021-07-29 21:44:19 │
+-------------+----------+---------------+---------------------+

```

### Generating a project from template

This process is very simple.

Having the folder where you want to generate the template, which in my case is **Website**, use the command **gen** to instantiate the template:

```command
$ tp gen project-web Website
```

Ready! Now you know how to save templates and use them with Templo. :D
