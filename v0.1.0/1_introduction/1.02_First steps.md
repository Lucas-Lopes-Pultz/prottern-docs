## First steps

### Creating an User Account
After checking if the package is installed you need to create an user account

```command
$ prottern signup
```

A signup form will appear:

```
Username: pultz-lucas
Email: prottern@email.com
Password: *****
Confirm your password: *****
```

### Saving templates to the repository
In the beginning there will be no template saved in the repository, so let's see now how to save a template.

First I need to have real files and folders structured to use it as reference.

Below is my example structure:

```
ProjectWeb
   L src
      L style.css
      L script.js 
   L index.html
```

My example is simple but larger structures of files and folders can be saved in the repository.

To save we will use the save command:

```command
$ prottern save ProjectWeb project-web
```

if you look into your local repository the "project-web" will be there.

```command
$ prottern repo
```

output:

```
+-------------+----------+---------------+---------------------+
│    name     │  owner   │ template_type │     created_at      │
+-------------+----------+---------------+---------------------+
│ project-web │ not-user │    Remote     │ 2021-07-29 21:44:19 │
+-------------+----------+---------------+---------------------+

```

### Generating a project from template

This process is very simple.

Having the folder where you want to generate the template, which in my case is **Website**, use the command **generate** or **gen** to instantiate the template:

```command
$ prottern gen project-web Website
```

If generated successfully, now you have a project identical to the other.

```
Website
   L src
      L style.css
      L script.js
   L index.html
```

Ready! Now you know how to save templates and generate it with Prottern. :D

Let's use it in projects!
