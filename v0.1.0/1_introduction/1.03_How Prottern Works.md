## How prottern Works
---

Prottern basically manipulates templates created by the user.

templates are [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) to generate files, directories and execute console commands.

The user can save a template from an directory and utilise that to generate projects from scratch or a piece of an existing 
projects.
