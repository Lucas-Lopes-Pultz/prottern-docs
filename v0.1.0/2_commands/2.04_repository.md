## Repository

The **repo** command lists all the templates in your local repository.

For example:

- I have three templates saved in my repository, with the names of: project-web, project-mobile, project-desktop.

- When typing the templates command, the three templates will appear in my terminal.

```command
$ tp repo
```

All templates will appear in a pretty table.
